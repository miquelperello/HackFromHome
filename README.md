# HackFromHome

### Inspiration
I wanted to learn web-scraping, and I saw a website of my university that shows reliable projection covid-19 cases, based on mathematical models. So I found that it would be so interesting to create a twitter bot(where everyone can access) that gives that information. Also I found an API that gives real time information about the coronavirus and I used it.

### What it does
Reply with a real time information about covid-19 in the country specified.
Reply with a projection of the covid-19 for the next three days on catalonia, spain or europe.
How I built it
I used the Tweepy API and Python and I also used WebScraping to extract the information about the prediction in this realiable web:https://biocomsc.upc.edu/en/covid-19

### Challenges I ran into
At the start of the hackaton i didn't know web scraping, so the part of extracting information of the website was a bit difficult.

### Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Learning how to web-scraping Work with APIs

### What I learned
How to create a Twitter Bot Know more about Python Data Scraping on web Connection to an API

### What's next for Corobot-19
It should be great to implement a cache, to avoid unnecessary access to the covid-19 API.

### Built With
beautiful-soup
pil
python
requests
tweepy
